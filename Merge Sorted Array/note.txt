1. in the source code, 
        if not m:
            nums1[:] = nums2[:]
            #assign each value, it may be wrong if you write:
            #nums1 = nums2

    there is difference between nums1 = nums2 and nums1[:] = nums2[:]

2. take extremely care with the corner cases:

    if m < 0 or n >= 0 and nums2[n] > nums1[m]:
    
    I forgot n>=0 at first

    Be clear in your mind!
