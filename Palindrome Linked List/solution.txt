solution.py get all the values from the linked list, and then reverse the value list,
compare it with original list by subtracting each pair of elemnts to see if the sum
of absolute differences is 0. The time and space complexity are O(n).

A better way is to find the middle node of the linked list, and reverse the second half
of the list. Then iterate through the first and the second half of to see if they are the
same. This algorithm has better space complexity.
