Unbelievable, the best method is Number Field Sieve...

I thought the best was to save a list of prime and try to divide one by one...

It reminds me that divide operation is much slower than multiplication, because the 
implementation of divide is trying to subtract as many times as possible, while 
there is multiplying unit for multiplicaiton.
