The idea is similar to the Link game, but in this game, what we link together are the different numbers.

use a variable to record the number, and another to be a counter.

then iterate through the list, if the number is the same with what we recorded, 
add the counter, otherwise, minus the counter by one.

if the counter is less than one, replace the number stored in the variable with current number,
and reset the counter to one.

after the iterator, the number left is the number appearing more than n/2 times
